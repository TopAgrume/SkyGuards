# Data Engineering Project
Final Project for the data engineering course:

# SkyGuard
SkyGuard is a project aimed at preventing mass casualties in crowded spaces. By deploying drones strategically, we monitor crowd density and alert authorities when danger thresholds are exceeded. Our proactive approach aims to reduce the annual toll of 2000 lives lost to overcrowding incidents, enhancing public safety and saving lives, with advanced analytics and real-time insights.
